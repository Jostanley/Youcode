    <h2> Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>By the end of this lesson, students will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand what a personal brand is and why it matters in tech.</li>
      <li>Learn how to create an authentic online presence as a frontend developer.</li>
      <li>Discover platforms to showcase skills and projects.</li>
      <li>Build consistency in content, style, and communication.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction: What Is a Personal Brand?</h2>
    <p>Your personal brand is how people see and remember you — both online and offline.  
    As a frontend developer, your brand represents your <b>skills, style, attitude, and professionalism</b>.</p>

    <div class="quote">
      “A strong personal brand doesn’t shout; it shows. Every project, post, or message you share adds a brick to your reputation.”
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2> Step 1: Define Who You Are</h2>
    <p>Start by asking these questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What kind of developer am I? (Creative, technical, minimalist, UI-focused?)</li>
      <li>What type of projects do I enjoy building most?</li>
      <li>Who do I want to work with — startups, small businesses, or agencies?</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="activity">
      <b> Exercise:</b>  write a short “brand statement” — one or two sentences describing your developer identity.  
      <br><br>
      Example: “I’m a frontend developer who builds clean, modern websites that help small businesses look professional online.”
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2> Step 2: Build Your Online Presence</h2>
    <p>To be discovered, people need to find you online. Here’s where to start:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Portfolio Website:</b> Create a simple site showing your name, bio, and projects.</li>
      <li><b>GitHub Profile:</b> Keep your projects public, with good READMEs and screenshots.</li>
      <li><b>LinkedIn:</b> Share updates, articles, or progress about your web development journey.</li>
      <li><b>Twitter/X or Threads:</b> Engage with other developers and share short tips or achievements.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="tip">
      <b> Note:</b>  consistency is more important than perfection. A small portfolio done well is better than no portfolio at all.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 3: Create a Visual Identity</h2>
    <p>Every strong brand has a consistent visual style. Students should choose:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A simple color palette (2–3 colors max)</li>
      <li>One or two professional fonts</li>
      <li>A consistent tone for posts and project descriptions</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example">
Example Style Guide:
Color palette: Blue (#007bff), White (#ffffff), Gray (#333333)
Font: "Poppins", "Roboto"
Tone: Friendly, confident, and educational.
    </div>

    <div class="activity">
       <b>Task:</b>  pick a color and font combination that feels “like them.”  
      This combination should be used on your portfolio and social banners.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 4: Showcase Your Work</h2>
    <p>Projects are the heart of your personal brand. Employers and clients care more about what you’ve built than what you say. Include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Project screenshots and short descriptions.</li>
      <li>Live links (e.g., deployed on GitHub Pages or Render).</li>
      <li>Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, etc.</li>
      <li>One or two lines about your process — what problem you solved.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
       <b> Tip:</b> Add a section in your portfolio titled “Behind the Code” — describe your thinking or design approach.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 5: Share Your Journey</h2>
    <p>People connect with real stories. Use social media to share your learning process, small wins, or new discoveries.  
    This makes you relatable and builds trust.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Post a weekly update: “I just built my first responsive navbar!”</li>
      <li>Share code snippets with images.</li>
      <li>Celebrate project launches.</li>
      <li>Teach something simple — one tip per post.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="quote">
      “Your journey is your brand. Share it, and people will follow your growth.”
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2> Step 6: Networking & Collaboration</h2>
    <p>Brand growth happens faster when you connect with others. Students should:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Join online developer communities (Discord, Reddit, Dev.to).</li>
      <li>Contribute to open-source or student projects.</li>
      <li>Collaborate with classmates to build small portfolio-worthy projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="activity">
    <b> Activity:</b>As a beginner, visit some GitHub profile of a friend or any GitHub  page review it and compare with yours to discover improvements you need to make.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 7: Build Authority Over Time</h2>
    <p>Personal branding is not a one-day project. It’s built through consistent action:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Update your portfolio every 2–3 months.</li>
      <li>Post regularly on LinkedIn or Twitter/X.</li>
      <li>Help others by answering beginner questions online.</li>
      <li>Start small — even sharing one tip weekly helps build credibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
       <b>Advice:</b>Just a Remind that being kind, reliable, and honest online is also part of branding. Character counts as much as skill.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2> Project</h2>
    <p>create a mini “personal brand kit” that includes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A one-line brand statement (who you are and what you do).</li>
      <li>A logo or simple name mark (created with Canva or Figma).</li>
      <li>A color + font combination for their portfolio site.</li>
      <li>A short bio for GitHub and LinkedIn.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="tip">
       <b> Tip:</b> Showcase the best 3 student brand kits on the class board or website to inspire others.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2> Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your personal brand is the story of your growth as a developer.</li>
      <li>Consistency across platforms builds recognition.</li>
      <li>Show your work — even small projects build credibility.</li>
      <li>Be authentic: share your wins, struggles, and lessons learned.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>“You are not just learning code — you are building your reputation, one line at a time.”</p>
