  <div class="section">
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>By the end of this lesson, students will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand where and how to find freelance clients online.</li>
      <li>Learn how to communicate professionally with clients.</li>
      <li>Know how to price their work fairly and write proposals.</li>

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction: From Portfolio to Paid Work</h2>
    <p>Now that you have built your online portfolio, the next step is to use it to attract real clients. Clients are people or companies who pay you to build websites or solve digital problems. In this lesson, we will learn how to find them, contact them, and keep them satisfied so they come back with more projects.</p>
    <div class="tip">
      <b> Note:</b>  Treat freelancing like a business — professionalism, time management, and communication are key.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 1: Where to Find Clients</h2>
    <p>There are several places where web developers can find freelance jobs. Here are the most common and trusted platforms:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Upwork</b> – Great for long-term projects and professional clients.</li>
      <li><b>Fiverr</b> – Best for beginners; you create small service packages called “gigs.”</li>
      <li><b>LinkedIn</b> – Build connections and showcase your portfolio to professionals.</li>
      <li><b>Freelancer.com</b> – Bid on projects and collaborate with global clients.</li>
      <li><b>Local Businesses</b> – Approach small shops, schools, or churches in your area who need websites.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="tip">
       <b> Tip:</b> Always link your portfolio in your freelancer profiles. It helps clients trust your skills immediately.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2> Step 2: How to Write a Winning Proposal</h2>
    <p>When applying for freelance jobs, you often need to send a short proposal to the client. This message should be clear, friendly, and professional.</p>
    <p>Here’s a simple example of a proposal you can use:</p>

    <div class="example">
Hi [Client Name],

I saw your job post and I’d love to help you build [Project Name or Type].  
I’m a web developer experienced in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
I recently created a similar project which you can view here: [Portfolio Link].  

I’ll ensure your website is fast, responsive, and easy to manage.  
Can we discuss your goals in more detail?

Thanks,  
Ejistan

    <div class="tip">
      <b>Class Activity:</b> Have students write their own short proposal and share it with the class for feedback.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 3: Pricing Your Work</h2>
    <p>Beginners often find it difficult to decide how much to charge. Here are some tips to guide you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start small: Offer simple websites between <b>$50 – $150</b> for practice.</li>
      <li>Charge more for complex or custom designs.</li>
      <li>As you gain experience, increase your rates — your skills have value!</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
      <b>Example:</b> A small business website (3–5 pages) might cost around <b>$200–$400</b> depending on features and time.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2> Step 4: Communicating with Clients</h2>
    <p>Good communication keeps clients happy and prevents confusion. Here’s what to remember:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Always greet clients politely and respond quickly.</li>
      <li>Ask questions if something is unclear.</li>
      <li>Give progress updates regularly.</li>
      <li>Be honest if there’s a delay — clients appreciate honesty more than silence.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example">
<b>Example Email:</b>

Hi [Client Name],  
Here’s a quick update on your website. I’ve completed the homepage and started working on the contact section.  
Would you like to review the progress so far?

Thanks,  
Ejistan

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 5: Delivering Projects Professionally</h2>
    <p>When your work is complete, send the final files or deploy the site online. Always test everything before delivery.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Check all links and forms are working.</li>
      <li>Ensure it looks good on desktop and mobile.</li>
      <li>Send clear instructions on how the client can update or manage it.</li>
      <li>Ask politely for feedback or testimonials after completion.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="tip">
      <b> Tip:</b> Use Google Drive or GitHub to share project files safely.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2> Step 6: Building Long-Term Relationships</h2>
    <p>Freelancing is not just about one-time jobs — it’s about creating long-term relationships with satisfied clients who return for more work. You can achieve this by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Delivering on time and with quality.</li>
      <li>Being polite and respectful in communication.</li>
      <li>Offering small follow-up support for free (e.g., fixing a minor bug).</li>
      <li>Sending thank-you messages after each project.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
       <b>Teacher’s Insight:</b> Let students know that one happy client can bring five more through recommendations!
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 7: Growing Your Freelance Career</h2>
    <p>As you complete more projects, you can scale up your career:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a <b>professional LinkedIn profile</b> showcasing your portfolio.</li>
      <li>Ask clients for testimonials and feature them on your website.</li>
      <li>Specialize in a niche (e.g., “Landing Pages for Small Businesses”).</li>
      <li>Start teaching others or collaborating with other developers.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
       <b>Success Key:</b> Consistency. Keep improving your skills, updating your portfolio, and networking every week.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2> Classroom Exercise</h2>
    <p>Ask each student to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Find a real freelance job post online (Upwork, Fiverr, or LinkedIn).</li>
      <li>Write a proposal for it using their portfolio link.</li>
      <li>Present their proposal to the class for peer review.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Summary & Reflection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Freelancing begins with a solid portfolio and confidence.</li>
      <li>Clients value honesty, skill, and clear communication.</li>
      <li>Delivering quality work builds trust and repeat business.</li>
      <li>Always learn, improve, and grow your professional presence.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Congratulations! You’ve now learned how to move from student developer to paid freelancer.</p>
